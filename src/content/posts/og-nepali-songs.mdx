# OG Songs of Nepal

Music holds a special place in my heart and has been my companion through my lowest moments. Whenever I feel down, I turn to music, and it becomes a bandage for my wounds. I'm not exaggerating when I say that music has given me so much, and I will always be grateful for it.

I've been listening to Nepali songs since I was very young, from the classic "Aadhikhola urlera aayo" to modern tracks like "Jhola gyang myachis, baby timi bad bitch." I've heard it all. You might think, "What terrible music taste this guy has!" But no, I don't particularly like that last song; I'm just illustrating the extremes and duality of Nepali music.

I vividly remember the days before cable TV and YouTube, when music only came through the radio or our black-and-white TV with its antenna. We had a DVD player, and one day while watching the movie "Khalnayak," the song "Magera paune bhaye ma" started playing. It was music to my ears, literally. I loved that song so much that I would fast-forward to the middle of the movie just to hear it.

Even though there have been many masterpieces through the years, I'll list some of the best – my absolute favorites, the OG songs. OG means Original Gangster, but here it means old yet timeless songs that are still widely loved.

## 1. Nachaheko Hoina by The Edge Band

"Nachaheko Hoina Tmilai" is from Edge Band's "Mero Prayas" album, released in 2010. I was 10 years old when this song came out. When I heard it for the first time, it was love at first sight – I loved it instantly. This well-crafted song is medicine for your first inevitable heartbreak. Even today, the younger generation actively listens to and sings this song. There's barely anyone who hasn't heard it. My favorite lines are:

*मेरि दिल कि रानी तिमी लाई, फूल सरि सजायको थिए*  
*सारा संसार भरी मा मैले, केवल तिमिलाइ नै रोजेको थिए*

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j4XhaDjDEE&list=RD0j4XhaDjDEE&start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Listen here</a>

Edge Band has given us other masterpieces like "Yo Dil Mero," "Samjhine Mutu," "Kasari," and many more.

## 2. Mero Prem by AXIX Band

"Mero Prem" (Adhuro Prem 2) is another blessing from Nepal's band era that touches the heart. This is another medicine for your heartbreak if the first song didn't do the trick. "Adhuro Prem" is equally beautiful and soulful.

*यदि माया नसा हो भने*  
*मलाई यही भ्रममा छोडिदेऊ*  
*सारा संसारले आँखा फेरोस्*  
*मलाई तिम्रो नयनमा बस्न देऊ*

This line hits different. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQTxBOEQVgA&list=RDmQTxBOEQVgA&start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Listen here</a>

## 3. Kehi Mitho Baat Gara by Narayan Gopal

We all know Narayan Gopal is a legendary Nepali singer. Known by the nickname "Swor Samrat" (Emperor of Voice), and rightfully so, he has given us beautiful songs to cherish. This song, composed by lyricist Kali Prasad Rijal, was originally recorded by Narayan Gopal in 1988 at the Music Nepal studio. Even though the song is old, young people still adore it. I still remember my friends and I singing this song together on our college tour. It was a truly magical moment that I'll never forget.

## 4. Gajalu Ti Thula Thula Aankha by Ghulam Ali

I heard this song for the first time about 8 years ago when I was studying in grade 11. I was mesmerized by the voice of Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali. I had a girlfriend then who also had big, beautiful eyes, so this song holds a special place in my heart. Regardless of that, "Gajalu Ti Thula Thula Aankha" is one of the most loved songs by all of us. Fun fact: the lyricist of this song is actually Late Shree 5 Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev.

## 5. Timi Nai Hau by Sabin Rai

Born on February 5, 1974, in Dharan, Nepal, Sabin began singing in the early 1990s. He's one of the most beloved artists among today's youth. He has given us many hits like "Timi Nai Hau," "Komal Tyo Timro," "Ma Sansar Jitne," "Gurans Ko Fed Muni," "Jau Ki Basu," and many more. Interestingly, everyone has their own favorite Sabin Rai song, but "Timi Nai Hau" is just so special and deserves the top spot.

## 6. Rituharu Ma Timi by Late Arun Thapa

This generation of Gen Z may not have heard of Arun Thapa. I also didn't know about him until I heard this beautiful song. There are two versions – the original by Arun Thapa and a remake by Buddha N. Shrestha. The best part of this song is its beautifully crafted lyrics:

*निर्दोष छन् ती तिम्रा हत्केलाहरू, तर मायाले भरिएका छन् औँलाहरू हो*  
*(पवित्र छन् तिम्रा लाजका गहना), तर चाहनाले भिजेका छन् ओठहरू*

Absolutely love this. How could anyone not?

## 7. Timi Bhane by ALBATROSS

The Nepali rock song "Timi Bhane" by Albatross is popular for jamming sessions in schools, colleges, or outings. Released on July 7, 2005, as part of their EP "Jo Jas Sanga Sambhandhit Chha," this song marked a significant milestone in the Nepali rock scene, showcasing the band's unique blend of alternative and hard rock elements. The song has since become one of Albatross's most iconic tracks, celebrated for its emotional depth and powerful instrumentation.

## 8. K Yo Maya Ho by B-8Eight

I really miss the time when Nepalese bands used to release banger after banger. B-8Eight has given us so many good songs, but they've disappeared from the scene recently. "K Yo Maya Ho" explores the feelings and confusion of falling in love. It captures the emotional journey of discovering love and how it changes a person. Even though this song is old and I haven't listened to it much recently, I remember every word, line, and verse.

## 9. Lajalu Muskan le Priyeshi by Kalind Band

My personal favorite love song, "Lajalu Muskan Le Priyesi," is surely one of the most underrated Nepali songs. Released in the late 1990s, this song is truly magical, and I feel so lucky to have discovered it. No matter how many times I listen to it, I never get tired of it.

*मायालु केहि त बोल न*  
*चाहन्छु तिमीलाई भन न*  
*गाँजलु आँखाले हेर न*  
*लजालु मुस्कानले प्रियसी*  
*चोरि लग्यौ मन मेरो तिमीले*

## 10. Syndicate by Bipul Chettri

There was a time when in every college program, there would always be at least one person who would sing "Syndicate" by Bipul Chettri. "Syndicate" is a simple story of two ordinary people sharing a public space and the individual fantasy world we sometimes enjoy being in. Bipul dai is one of the most loved and adored singers in the Nepali music industry, who has given us "Ram Sailee," "Ashish," "Asaar," "Junkeri," and many more. "Syndicate" is a truly magical song that's so fun to listen to.

## 11. Gairi Khet Ko by Asha Bhosle

"Gairi Khet Ko" is a Nepali song sung by legendary Indian singer Asha Bhosle, and my god, is it beautiful. The song is a heart-touching blend of love, longing, and unfulfilled desire. The melody carries traditional Nepali folk elements – simple yet deeply emotional. The lyrics hit different, especially this part:

*खोला पारी तरि दिने*  
*तुहिना को फाँको*  
*पहिलो माया छुटै हाल्यो*  
*कलेजी मा राँको*

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2F0eWTw9PA&list=RDt2F0eWTw9PA&start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Listen here</a>

## 12. Yo Jindagani by Nepathya

Nepathya is a legendary Nepali folk-rock band known for blending traditional melodies with modern rock to express themes of love, life, and patriotism. Led by Amrit Gurung, the band has united generations with its powerful music and meaningful lyrics. "Yo Jindagani" is a poignant and uplifting folk-rock anthem that reflects on the varied shades of life – joy and sorrow, struggle and resilience.

*जीवन हो घाम छाँया*  
*सुख-दुःख दुवै हुन्छ*  
*जीवन हो बिना माया*  
*छटपटि तड्पन हुन्छ*

As soon as this starts playing, I feel the energy and motivation. I want to get loud and sing without any fear.

## 13. Chitthi Bhitra by Sajjan Raj Vaidya

"Chitthi Bhitra" is a soulful love ballad by Sajjan Raj Vaidya, released in 2018. The song beautifully captures the raw emotions of pouring one's heart out through a letter. Being a modern artist who only started making music in 2014, maybe it's not fair to put him on this OG list, but the number of hits he's given us in the last decade at least deserves a mention. "Chitthi Bhitra" is truly beautiful and never gets old no matter how many times I listen to it. Of the 74M views on YouTube, it feels like 1M is from me alone.
