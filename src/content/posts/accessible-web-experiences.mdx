## Why Accessibility Matters
<p>Web accessibility isn't just a legal requirementâ€”it's a fundamental aspect of good design. When we create accessible websites, we ensure that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and use our digital content effectively.</p>

### Understanding Accessibility Guidelines
<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a comprehensive framework for creating accessible web content. These guidelines cover everything from text alternatives for images to keyboard navigation and color contrast requirements.</p>

### Semantic HTML: The Foundation
<p>Using semantic HTML elements is the first step toward accessibility. Elements like <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> provide structure that screen readers can interpret, making navigation easier for users with visual impairments.</p>

### Color and Contrast
<p>Color should never be the only way to convey information. Ensure sufficient contrast ratios between text and background colors, and provide alternative ways to distinguish elements beyond color alone.</p>

### Keyboard Navigation
<p>Many users rely on keyboard navigation. Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard, with clear focus indicators and logical tab order.</p>

## Testing and Validation
<p>Regular testing with accessibility tools and real users is essential. Automated tools can catch many issues, but manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation provides the most accurate assessment of accessibility.</p>

<p>By prioritizing accessibility from the start, we create better experiences for all users while building more robust and maintainable code.</p>
